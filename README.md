# Sweet-Bouquet
A sweet bouquet is a charming and creative arrangement made of assorted chocolates, candies, or other sweet treats, designed to look like a beautiful flower bouquet. Instead of real flowers, it uses colorful wrappers, ribbons, and decorative sticks to form “blossoms” that are both eye-catching and delicious.
